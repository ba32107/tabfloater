# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to TabFloater. Your time and work is really appreciated!

Please take a minute to read this document. Please also have a look at our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), if you haven't already.

**Note:** If you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue or a Pull Request. Email [security@tabfloater.io](mailto:security@tabfloater.io) instead.

### Providing feedback

The **main form of contribution** we are currently looking for is feedback. We would love to hear what you think about TabFloater. Do you have a suggestion? Did you encounter a bug? Something not working as expected? Please go ahead and [open an issue](https://github.com/tabfloater/tabfloater/issues/new/choose). We promise we will reply promptly!

### Code contributions

Although at this stage of the project we are primarily looking for feedback, you are welcome to submit code contributions as well. Have a look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/tabfloater/tabfloater/labels/help%20wanted) where we need help.

If you would like to implement something new, please open an issue first to have a discussion about the change (unless it's trivial, such as a typo fix). This will ensure that you don't put a lot of work into a change that we might not be able to include in the project.

### Documentation & other

Did you notice a typo? A development setup step is missing? Something looks weird on our website? Please open an issue or a Pull Request - we will be very grateful!

### Unsure how to start?

If you have never contributed to an open source project before, check out [this great guide](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) on how to get started. Feel free to also just ask questions in this repository - we will help you!

We also have a label for issues specifically for first-time contributors, have a look [here](https://github.com/tabfloater/tabfloater/labels/first-timers-only).

### Thank you!

And again, thank you - contributing to any open source project takes time and effort, and we are glad you chose TabFloater today.
